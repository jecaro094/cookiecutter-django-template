# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

To run cookie cutter, use this command:

```bash
cookiecutter ./cookiexutter-django-template
```

## Docker compose

To run with docker compose, run this:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up
```

The first command is so that we can remove dangling container and volumes, from previous docker runs.
